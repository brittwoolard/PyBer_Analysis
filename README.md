# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
Analysis and visualization of Pyber company data to provide insights and understand the correlation between ride share data by city and average fare. 
### Background and Challenges
Assignment given by the CEO to create summary statistics of the ride-sharing data. The key deliverables are 
•	Summary data to highlights key metrics in a dataframe 
•	A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type 
•	Analysis summary and recommendations
The project will be done using python Jupyter Notebook.
### Deliverables
•	Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type. Summary aggregations with key metrics like 
o	Total Rides 
o	Total Drivers
o	Total Fares
o	Average Fare Per Ride
o	Average Fare per Driver

•	Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.
o	Sum of fares for each week 
o	A multiline graph that shows fares by City type

### Summary 
Based on the analysis, it is evident that we have higher usage of rides share than the other areas; rural and suburban. More detailed analysis is recommended to be able to come up with good market strategy. We could for example track information about the length of ride taken. Rural city for instance might require longer rides, having this information can help us better understand and eliminate issue of data skew
From the visualization of the chart using multiline graph, we were able to see that fare prices are consistent across city types, though a little bit of spike but overall consistent on average. We were also able to see the majority of the money been made comes from urban city and rural city being the lowest.
Our overall observation from the analysis tells us that even if the average fair price of the rural is higher, more dollar volume is made from urban rides. We can also deduce that the more drivers we have in a city makes the average fare price reduce
